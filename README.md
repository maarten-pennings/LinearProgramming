# LinearProgramming
Trying linear programming: find the best outcome (such as lowest cost) in a model with linear relationships.

## Projects

I did two small trials.

- I read the book "OptArt" nearly a year ago, it triggered my interest in linear programming, but it required a paid tool.
  I found this [diet](diet/diet.ipynb) problem on a website which simply used a Python package (`pulp`) instead of a paid tool. I gave it a try.
- That was successful, so a next project was to replicate an introductory problem (chapter 3) in the [optart](optart/optart.ipynb) book.
