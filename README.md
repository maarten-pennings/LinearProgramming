# LinearProgramming
Trying linear programming: find the best outcome (such as lowest cost) in a model with linear relationships.

## Projects

I did some small trials.

- I read the book [OptArt](https://www.amazon.com/Opt-Art-Mathematical-Optimization-Visual/dp/0691164061) nearly a year ago.
  It (re)triggered my interest in linear programming, but it required a paid tool.
  Recently, I found this [diet](diet/diet.ipynb) problem on a website which simply used the `pulp` Python package instead of a paid tool. 
  I gave it a try.
- That was successful, so a next project was to replicate the [introductory problem](optart/optart.ipynb) (chapter 3) in the OptArt book.
- The third project was a bit more serious (25 variables).
  I replicated chapter 4 of the OptArt book: [assign profs to courses](linassign/LinAssign.ipynb).
